# Explanation 
A port scanner is an application designed to probe a server or host for open ports. Such an application may be used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify network services running on a host and exploit vulnerabilities

# Overview
Welcome to the Port Scanner.
This program will allow you to enter a host of your choice to scan and find open ports (I recommend one that you are allowed to scan since an unauthorized scan is prohibited by the law)
This program will scan the ports in the host and will print them in your screen so you get to chose what to do with them.

# Network Communication

The achitecture used in this project is host to host, meaning from your computer you will connect to another device. 
This program is running moules that allow the host to connect through the network to another host either in the same network or in another network.
